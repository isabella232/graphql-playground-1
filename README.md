# Rubrik GraphQL Playground

The Rubrik GraphQL Playground is a cross-platform desktop application designed to allow you to interact with the Rubrik GraphQL services for both Polaris and CDM. The latest versions can be downloaded on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/rubrikinc/graphql-playground/releases).

GraphQL is fully supported in CDM v5.2 but _currently_ has limited support in Polaris.
